## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. The **ESP32** controls the mower‚Äôs movement using the **L298N H-Bridge** to drive the two DC wheel motors.
2. The **ultrasonic sensor**, mounted on a servo, continuously scans for obstacles.
3. If an obstacle is detected, the ESP32 makes the mower stop, turn, and continue in a new direction.
4. A **separate DC motor spins the cutting blade**, enabling grass cutting while the mower moves.
5. Power is distributed through a **regulatorr**, ensuring stable 5V for the ESP32, servo, and sensors.
6. Future improvements can integrate **IoT features** for remote monitoring and scheduling.
